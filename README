UDP Chat [1]
============

Experimental UDP-based chat application.

The repository only contains my old clone of "talk", implementing
character-by-character chat over UDP.


Usage
-----

    talk <local port> <remote host> <remote port>

If you want to chat with a user on "remote.host.example" and you (over
another channel) have agreed to use port 8877, you run:

    talk 8877 remote.host.example 8877

And your friend runs:

    talk 8877 your.host.example 8877

And then it is just a matter of typing...

If you want to play with it on a single machine, open two terminals, and
run the program in both, but with the port numbers reversed:

    talk 8877 localhost 7788

    talk 7788 localhost 8877

Once both instances are running, you're ready to chat.


Building
--------

    make build


Testing
-------

    make test


Installing
----------

Set PREFIX and DESTDIR to the apropriate values (default: PREFIX="${HOME}"
and DESTDIR="") and then run:

    make install
